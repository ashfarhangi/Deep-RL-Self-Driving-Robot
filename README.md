# Deep-RL-Self-Driving-Robot Documentation

UCF HEC404 Lab: A deep reinforcement learning platform for self driving robots
## Books:
[Learning ROS for Robotics Programming - Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/hardware-and-creative/learning-ros-robotics-programming-second-edition)
## Sources:
  For rapid setup of environment the following sources has been used:   
 1. [AWS-Deep Racer](https://github.com/aws-robotics/aws-robomaker-sample-application-deepracer)   
 2. gazebo_worlds package. If you do not have the package,
install it before you continue.    
## Simulation of real environment:


 2. gazebo_worlds package. If you do not have the package,
install it before you continue.    
  To check the model, you will only have to start the .launch file using the
following command:   
$ roslaunch gazebo_ros racetrack.launch
